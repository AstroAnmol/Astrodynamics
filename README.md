C++ based repository for astrodynamics simulations.
Used primarily for coursework and course projects at the University of Maryland:
 - ENAE601: Astrodynamics
 - ENAE741: Interplanetary Navigation and Guidance

The course project involved implementing Sentineela and Casalino's Genetic Algorithm to find low-thrust trajectories to the outer planets.
